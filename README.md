# Implement a Subscription Service for Cryptocurrency Updates

* As a cryptocurrency user, I want to receive 24-hour updates on currency prices along with a funny joke.

* As a user, I want to receive this information and the joke in my email, eliminating the need to search for it daily.

# Web Application Details
When you open the web application in your browser, you will see the currency name, symbol, and price converted into US dollars. The joke is displayed just below the currency information and will refresh when the user reloads the page.

Subscribers to the service will receive one email and one joke daily, ensuring that the jokes are always up-to-date with currency information changes. At the bottom of the page, there is a box where users can input their email and submit it using the "Subscribe" button. This allows those seeking cryptocurrency information to avoid the need to search the web constantly and brightens their day with a fun joke!
